## 🎲 How the Game Works

- The board has **3x3** cells.  
- Player **X** always starts first.  
- Turns alternate automatically between **X** and **O**.  
- The game detects:  
  - ✅ If a player wins (3 in a row).  
  - 🤝 If there is a tie (all cells filled without a winner).  
- You can **restart** the game anytime using the **Restart** button.  
- Two game modes are available:  
  - **2 Players** → Two people playing on the same device.  
  - **Player vs AI** → Player X vs a **basic AI** (AI makes simple moves like choosing center, corners, or blocking).
